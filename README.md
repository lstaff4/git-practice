# "Our Project" README.md

Our goal in this project is to develop a basic Express application.
This will be done as a team with a mentor to practice good git habits.

The Express application must meet the following requirements:
* [ ] GET /            => Displays a hello world HTML page.
* [ ] GET /hello/:name => Displays a hello page to a specific person.
* [ ] GET /about       => Displays some information about this project (it can be the same as the README.)
* [ ] If a request does not match the above, display a 404 Page and appropriate HTTP status.
